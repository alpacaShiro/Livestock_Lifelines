**Livestock Lifelines:** Analyzing Trends to Combat Food Insecurity in the Philippines

## Final Project Guidelines for Data Analysis and Visualization Course
### Project Overview:
For your final project, you will choose a dataset from a government agency and perform a comprehensive data analysis and visualization. Additionally, the final output must include the implementation of a supervised or unsupervised machine learning model. The project is divided into two parts: the Preliminary Presentation (Prelim) and the Final Presentation (Finals).

### Step-by-Step Instructions:
#### Selecting a Dataset:
You must find a dataset provided by a government agency. Some examples include datasets from the Department of Education (DepEd), Department of Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture (DA), National Statistics Office (NSO), or any similar governmental organization.
Ensure that the dataset is sufficiently complex to allow for meaningful analysis and visualization (at least 500 rows and 5 columns). It should also be relevant to real-world problems or decision-making.

#### Preliminary Presentation (Prelim):
##### Presentation Date: (Insert date)
##### Content:
- **Background of the Dataset:** Provide details on where the dataset was obtained, the agency's role, and the purpose of the data. Explain the structure of the dataset, including variables and data types.
- **Preliminary Data Analysis:** Conduct an initial exploration of the data. This may include data cleaning, missing value handling, and summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
- **Preliminary Visualization:** Present initial visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, histograms, etc.) that summarize key insights from the dataset.
- **Preliminary Machine Learning Model:** Briefly introduce the type of machine learning model (supervised or unsupervised) that you plan to implement in your final analysis.
Insights: Present your preliminary findings and discuss any interesting trends or observations.

#### Final Presentation (Finals):
##### Presentation Date: (Insert date)
##### Content:
Comprehensive Data Analysis: Perform a full analysis of the dataset, incorporating advanced techniques such as correlations, groupings, or time series analysis where appropriate. Ensure the data is cleaned and properly prepared for analysis.

###### Machine Learning Model Implementation:
1. Choose either a supervised model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or classification) or an unsupervised model (e.g., clustering using K-means or PCA).
2. Train the model using your dataset, and evaluate its performance.
3. Explain your choice of model and the metrics used to evaluate its accuracy or effectiveness.
4. **Advanced Data Visualization:** Use multiple forms of data visualizations (scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps, etc.) to convey your findings effectively. Ensure that visualizations are meaningful and well-explained.
5. **Conclusion and Recommendations:** Based on your analysis and model results, provide recommendations or conclusions. Discuss the real-world implications of your findings.

### Report Submission:
Along with your final presentation, you are required to submit a detailed report documenting your entire process, including data cleaning, analysis steps, visualizations, machine learning model implementation, and findings. Ensure the report is well-structured and professional.
